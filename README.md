This repository is created to hold the resources for Skill Analytics team.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This is a demonstration of the UKG Skill Analytics Portal.

# To view the project, you need to open the html file on any of web browsers(firefox,chrome,edge). For a better experience, we reccommend using Mozilla FireFox.

# Please put your OPEN_AI_KEY in file.txt.

# Note: Few points about our Competency portal:
# Hover on the tiles displayed in My Skills section to know the proficiency details and more information.
# The OpenAI bot which we have implemented can provide answer to all the queries. We can enable it by clicking on "Ask anything to our interactive bot".
# we are using hard-coded values in the tables for the Insights tab. This will be modified in future to fetch the employee statistics from the data source itself.
